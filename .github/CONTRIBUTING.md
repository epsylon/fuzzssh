# Contributing to FuzzSSH

## Reporting bugs

Please report all bugs on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/epsylon/FuzzSSH/issues).

### Guidelines

* Before you submit a bug report, search both [open](https://github.com/epsylon/FuzzSSH/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) and [closed](https://github.com/epsylon/FuzzSSH/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to make sure the issue has not come up before. 

* Make sure you can reproduce the bug with the latest development version of FuzzSSH.

* Your report should give detailed instructions on how to reproduce the problem. If FuzzSSH raises an unhandled exception, the entire traceback is needed. Details of the unexpected behaviour are welcome too. A small test case (just a few lines) is ideal.

* If you are making an enhancement request, lay out the rationale for the feature you are requesting. *Why would this feature be useful?*

## Submitting code changes

All code contributions are greatly appreciated.

Our preferred method of patch submission is via a Git [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

### Guidelines

In order to maintain consistency and readability throughout the code, we ask that you adhere to the following instructions:

* Each patch should make one logical change.
* Avoid tabbing, use four blank spaces instead.
* Before you put time into a non-trivial patch, it is worth discussing it privately by [email](mailto:epsylon@riseup.net).
* Do not change style on numerous files in one single pull request, we can [discuss](mailto:epsylon@riseup.net) about those before doing any major restyling, but be sure that personal preferences not having a strong support in [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) will likely to be rejected.
* Make changes on less than five files per single pull request - there is rarely a good reason to have more than five files changed on one pull request, as this dramatically increases the review time required to land (commit) any of those pull requests.
* Style that is too different from main branch will be ''adapted'' by the developers side.

### Licensing

By submitting code contributions to the FuzzSSH developers or via Git pull request, checking them into the FuzzSSH source code repository, it is understood (unless you specify otherwise) that you are offering the FuzzSSH copyright holders the unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code. This is important because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems for other software projects (such as KDE and NASM). If you wish to specify special license conditions of your contributions, just say so when you send them.
